MonScan/ChangeLog

2008-10-23  Eric Shearer Hazen  <ehazen@srv-C2C05-07.cms>

        * MonRun.cc: Add column expressions and debug
        * GetDccTTS: fix bugs

2008-10-10  Eric Shearer Hazen  <ehazen@srv-C2C05-07.cms>

        * Add GetDccTTS, fix various things.

2008-10-10  Eric Shearer Hazen  <ehazen@lxplus245.cern.ch>

        * First working version.  Command-line tool "MonRun" usage:
        MonRun <run_number> <file1> [<file2>...]

        Searches HCAL_SUPERVISOR_STATE file (path hardwired in MonRun.cc) for
        run time range.  Does binary search for start of time in each <file>
        and outputs matching lines.

        Basically a test bed for the class, but could be used in a script.

RawAnalysis/ChangeLog

        * Fix dump level to work as documented

2008-04-02  Eric Hazen  <hazen@cms2.bu.edu>

        * First release of dump_FED.exe utility
        This program can dump 'deadbeef' format raw binary files,
        such as produced by the 'DCC/DUMP' command of DCCdiagnose.exe.

        It takes a few options:

        <filename>   name of ".dat" binary file, which must start with 0xdeadbeef.

        -d <level>
           Dump every event
             level = 1   Dump DCC headers only
             level = 2   Dump DCC and HTR headers
             level = 3   Dump raw hex data

        -e   Check EvN
        -b   Check BcN
        -o   Check OrN
        -s   Check HTR status and LRB errors
        -t   Display TTS state changes

MonScan/README

Simple command-line tools to extract MonLogger data from big test files.
First is is recommended to make a variable pointing to the MonLogger output:

   export MON="/nfshome0/hcalsw/monlog_loc/ALL"

To extract data for a particular run:

   ./MonRun <run> <file>

i.e.

   ./MonRun 67122 $MON/MONITOR_DCC_STTS_STATE_TIMERS.txt

This will print all rows for the run number.  To specify which
columns to include in the output, specify each with -c:

   ./MonRun 67122 $MON/MONITOR_DCC_STTS_STATE_TIMERS.txt -c OVF_WARN_TIMER -c BUSY_TIMER

To filter for particular values, use an expression for -c:

   ./MonRun 67122 $MON/MONITOR_DCC_STTS_STATE_TIMERS.txt -c 'OVF_WARN_TIMER>0' -c 'BUSY_TIMER>0'

    NOTE:  you must quote or escape the expressions if you use '>' or '<'.

Expression Syntax:

    <column><op><value>

    <column> = any column name found in the file
    <op> :== { "=" | "!=" | ">" | "<" }
    <value> = a 64-bit decimal or hex value

The comparisons are currently only numeric.

Finally, there is another program "GetDccTTS" which will read lines from
MONITOR_DCC_STTS_STATE_TIMERS.txt (output from first MonRun example above)
and summarize the TTS states by FED.

GetStatus/ChangeLog

2008-08-30  Eric Shearer Hazen  <hazen@lxcmdtest3>

        * Changes to htr scripts by Tullio for debugging close-space triggers

2008-07-29  Eric Shearer Hazen  <ehazen@srv-C2C05-07.cms>

        * Put in subversion.
          Status capture from all DCC and HTR to a single directory.
          To use:
            Extract tarball
            $ cd GetStatus
            $ ./getAllCrates.sh <run_number>
            (creates a directory tree under run#####Output/)

          To make HTML summary:
            $ ./link_errors.pl run#####Output/* > Run#####.html

AutoDIM/README

This directory contains some tools to automatically run EricDIM on a range of runs
found by reading the DBS database.

The perl script queries the DBS for each run.  For any run which reports files,
a trivial CMSSW job is run to see if there are any HCAL FEDs in the run.
If there are, an EricDIM job is run.

  find_runs_dbs.pl   main perl script.  Requires some tweaking.
                     usage:  find_runs_dbs.pl <first_run> <last_run>

  DDSearchCLI.py     DBS python script downloaded from DBS2 page
  EricRender.cc      Root script to render EricDIM root output to pdf
